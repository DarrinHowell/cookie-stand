                                With the PNW being our stomping grounds, 
                                our family had made it a tradition to 
                                bake cookies that reminded us of the natural
                                beauty of the Northwest.

                            we decided to throw some secret ingredients
                            from our family recipe into our salmon cookies.

                                on our street began clamoring for our secret recipe. 
                                My wife and I both had an "Aha" moment. We both
                                had enterpeneural inclincations, and one night, 
                                we sat down and started drafting the blueprints of 
                                what would be the start of us living and seizing our dreams.
