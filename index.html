                            With the PNW being our stomping grounds, 
                            our family had made it a tradition to 
                            bake cookies that reminded us of the natural
                            beauty of the Northwest.

                        <p>In addition to packing our cookies with love
                            we decided to throw some secret ingredients
                            from our family recipe into our salmon cookies.

                            neighbors began clamoring for our secret recipe. 
                            My wife and I both had an "Aha" moment. We both
                            had enterpeneural inclincations, and one night, 
                            we sat down and started drafting the blueprints of 
                            what would be the start of us living and seizing our dreams.
